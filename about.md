This is a personal blog website, where I share knowledge. While I believe that most of the things that I write in these blogs are already known to the person with neurotypical cognitive functioning, the catch is the person reading the blog has most probably lost the touch of this sort of knowledge because of the untruthfulness of what we proudly call 'civilization'.
